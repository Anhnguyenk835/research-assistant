  "answer": "{\n  \"response\": \"Document 1 introduces the BLAZER methodology for training specialized LLM agents for robotic manipulation [1]. The data generation process is further described in Document 2, which states that many efforts have been dedicated to scaling up training data for manipulation tasks [2]. Some works collect real-world grasping data by deploying random trials followed by verification as well as collection of human demonstrations [2]. Another approach is to collect demonstrations in simulation, which can be challenging as it requires significant human efforts to create diverse simulation tasks and scenes [2]. The BLAZER framework proposes a solution where an arbitrary number of data can be generated in simulation, benefiting from the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs to synthesize verification data with no human intervention [2].\",\n  \"sources\": [\n    {\n      \"inline_index\": 0,\n      \"rank\": 1,\n      \"arxiv_id\": \"2510.08572v1\",\n      \"title\": \"BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data Generation\",\n      \"section\": \"III.
